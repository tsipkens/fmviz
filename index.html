    <p>
      The primary function of any mask is to filter particles out of the air that passes
      through the mask, which is relevant to preventing the spread of the COVID-19
      and other respiratory diseases. Filtration occurs as a result of several mechanisms, including
      <b>impaction</b>, <b>interception</b>, <b>diffusion</b>,
      and <b>electrostatic attraction</b>.
    </p>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <img src="imgs/01_schem1.svg" alt="Impaction and interception" style="max-width:400px;width:100%;padding:13px;padding-bottom:0px;fill:red;"></img>
      <img src="imgs/01_schem2.svg" alt="Diffusion and electrostatic" style="max-width:400px;width:100%;padding:13px;padding-bottom:0px;"></img>
    </div>

    <p>
      Impaction tends to dominate for larger particles,
      while diffusion is most significant for smaller particles. Electrostatic charges
      in the mask, as are typically present in N95-compliant masks, tend to enhance
      particle filtration but also tend to hold up rather poorly when the mask
      is sanitized. For example, washing most N95-compliant masks with soap and water
      will significantly reduce their filtration properties.

    <h2>FILTRATION & PRESSURE DROP</h2>

    <p>
      This first graphic uses data from
      <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a>
      to examine the filtration properties of face masks alongside a
      second important property: <b>pressure drop</b>.
      Filtration has rather intuitive consequences for face masks. If a face
      masks has poor filtration properties, particles (perhaps containing virus) are allowed to
      pass through the fabric and reach the wearer, reducing the utility
      of the mask.
      The consequences of a poor pressure drop are less direct.
      Pressure drop denotes resistance. In this respect,
      a low pressure drop is preferable for two reasons. It (1) makes
      for a more breathable mask, which is less likely to irritate the wearer, and
      (2) results in less leakage, improving
      the overall utility of the mask.
    </p>

    <p>
      A good mask has a balance of both of these properties. The following plot considers
      these properties for some common materials. Uncertainties in the data are generally larger for low
      fitration efficiencies (negative filtration efficiencies occasionally reflect this; they
      are artifacts of the measurements and are not physical).
      Generally materials in the upper-left region of the plot (high filtration, low pressure drop)
      are the best. N95 masks are located on the upper axis,
      effectively filtering 100% of particles at these sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Circles with thicker outlines indicate materials with some form of sanitization
      treatment applied (e.g., laundered or heated).
    </p>

    <h3>Q&A</h3>

    <a class="anchor" id="leakage-note"></a>
    <div class="text-outside">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><span class="plus">+</span> <b>What about leakage around the mask?</b></button>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          This is a key question.
        </p>

        <p>
          We note that the focus of this data is on
          the <b>materials</b> themselves. As such, these curves <b>do not</b> consider
          leakage around the mask. This is another very important feature in
          constructing an effective masks but requires different kinds of
          tests that are wearer-specific. There are studies by other
          aerosol researchers and health professionals considering this
          aspect of mask construction.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252">Konda et al. (2020)</a>,
          for example, present the difference in filtration between candidate materials with and
          without leakage. This research found a gap representing only 0.5-2% of the surface
          area reduced the performance of an N95-compliant mask from 99% to less than 15% filtration.
          It is worth noting that those meausurements correspond to where a majority of the
          particles are near the lower end of the particle size range considered here.
          The largest human-generated particles (that is, the particles you can see, which
          are above the size range even considered here) will travel <b>ballistically</b>
          (that is, more of less on straight trajectories), such that leakage should
          trend downwards, even if some of the particles from the deflected spray
          will still escape the masks in practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless, the mask will function better if one reduces the impact of
          gaps. We recommend maximizing the surface area
          of air exchange to improve effective ventilation. A cup-shape or duck
          bill design may be preferred. Other solutions to reduce gaps include
          external braces, sponge nose pads, or reinforced nose wires.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, any mask is still better than no mask as (1) the remaining filtration
          efficiency (~15% for the N95-compliant masks in the
          <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252">Konda et al. (2020)</a>
          study) will filter some of the smaller particles and (2) the mask should
          significantly reduce the fraction of larger droplets released into the air.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="text-outside">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><span class="plus">+</span> Why are some of the materials identified by their physcial colour?</button>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          We occasionally characterize the materials by their physical colour. This is
          done as there is often limited information available about the specific material properties (e.g., thread count).
          In this regard, the colour is simply used to denote different materials within
          a similar material class.

          Accordingly, this data should be interpretted as indicating the potential variability
          of filtration and pressure drop that could be associated with a given
          type of material.
        </p>

        <p>
          A pertinent example is the knit cottons, which have variable quality
          despite being a similar material to the consumer.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <a class="anchor" id="hqual"></a>
    <div class="text-outside">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><span class="plus">+</span> What do the dashed lines in the figure represent? The short answer: <b>quality</b>.</button>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          In the plot below, dashed lines correspond to lines of constant <b>quality</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A good (or high) quality denotes a hybrid of good filtration
          while maintaining a low pressure drop. Infinite quality would correspond
          to a material that filters all of the particles, with no pressure drop.
          Naturally, real materials have trouble realizing this ideal. Masks with
          the highest quality in this study include N95-compliant and surgical masks.
          N95-compliant masks in some cases essentially blocked 100% of particles
          (within the limits of the current measurement apparatus), such that the quality approached ∞.
          Calculations of quality, <i>Q</i>, use the natural number as a base
          (this varies in the literature and should be checked between studies);
          pressures drop, Δ<i>p</i>, in kPa;
          and the filtration efficiency, η, as a fraction;
          in the following expression:
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Q</i> = −ln(1 − η)/Δ<i>p</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          For more details on how quality is defined and what it means, we refer the reader
          to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a> and the references

    <div class="text-outside">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><span class="plus">+</span> What flow rate was used?</button>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          We used a flow rate of 1 LPM, yielding a face velocity of 4.9 cm/s,
          below that used in the NIOSH N95 standard (8-9 cm/s).

    <div class="text-outside">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><span class="plus">+</span> What do the extra letters in brackets mean (e.g., W5)?</button>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          Simply put, these are codes we assign to each case, composed of characters
          identifying a material, its structure, number of layers used during measurement,
          and treatment applied (e.g., laundered), if any. While we provide these codes
          for reference back to the associated paper, in most instances the reader can
          ignore these codes.
        </p>

        <p>
          For those more interested:
        </p>

        <p style="padding-left:10px;">
          <b style="color:var(--a0)">1.</b>
          The first letter or pair of letters generally denotes the material structure,
          using <b>W</b> for woven materials, <b>K</b> for knit materials,
          <b>CP</b> for cut pile materials (e.g., corduroy), and <b>nW</b> for non-woven
          materials. Composite masks, such as the N95-compliant materials tested,
          have different codes (e.g., <b>ASTM</b> for surgical masks that adhere to the
          ASTM standard).

          The different material structures can be added or removed from the plot using the
          checkboxes in the controls above the first plot.
        </p>

        <p style="padding-left:10px;">
          <b style="color:var(--a0)">2.</b>
          The second component is a number used to identify the different
          materials within a given material structure. As the number is only
          used to identify the material, it does not contain any information
          about the material makeup or structure.
        </p>

        <p style="padding-left:10px;">
          <b style="color:var(--a0)">3.</b>
          Next, some codes append <b>x*</b> to denote if multiple layers
          were used during the test. For example <b>K4x2</b> is four layers of
          the K4 material (Double-knit jersey, yellow). If the <b>x*</b>
          component is missing, a single layer of the material was used.
        </p>

        <p style="padding-left:10px;">
          <b style="color:var(--a0)">4.</b>
          Finally, some codes append a space followed by a code denoting if
          a sanitization treatment was applied to the material. Examples include,
          <b>HS</b> for heat treatment, <b>IPA</b> for isopropyl alcohol treatments,
          <b>WD</b> for laundering, and <b>SW</b> for washing with soap and water.
          If no such code is appended, the material is in its original condition.
          If santization was repeatedly applied, this latter part of the code
          will also be appended with <b>x*</b> (e.g., <b>WDx10</b> denotes
          materials laundered ten times).
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, a code
          denoting a knit material that has been laundered multiple times is
          <b>K4x4 WDx4</b>. A list of the codes is included in the table at the bottom
          of this page.

          This classification refers to whether or not the mask meets the

      Here, the box corresponds to the 25th and 75th quantiles for a given structure,
      while the whiskers correspond to the 5th and 95th quantiles.
      In this plot, quality is capped at 1,000 and corresponds to the filtration at <b>d<sub>a</sub> = 2.8 microns</b>.

    <h2>DESIGN YOUR OWN MASK</h2>

    <h3>Considering size-resolved, multilayer mask filtration.</h3>

    <p>
      Not all particle sizes are filtered in the same way. For example, small particles
      tend to pass through masks more easily, resulting in lower filtration efficiencies.
      This second graphic examines the size-resolved mask filtration of the data from
      <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a>.
      Generally, curves higher on the plot are preferred, through, these materials
      may result in an unreasonable pressure drops that make the mask uncomfortable to wear
      and lead to larger amounts of leakage.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, this graphic estimates the filtration properties of
      masks composed of multiple layers.
      In this regard, solid, coloured lines indicate individual filter layers, while
      the black, dashed line corresponds to an estimate combining all of the
      selected feature layers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Individual feature layers can be added,
      removed, or changed using the dropdown boxes and
      can include up to <b>three layers</b>, the number recommended by the WHO.

          using the product of the particle penetration (one minus the filtration efficiency
          as a fraction) for individual layers.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is worth noting that some recent work (e.g.,
          <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c05025">Zangmeister et al. (2020)</a> and
          <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a>)
          suggests that the first layer may filter a disproportionate number of particles.
          In these cases, the presented estimates are likely to be overly optimistic.

      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          In short, yes. It is well-established that the filtration
          efficiency consistently decreases as the particles get smaller (to the left)
          for this size range.
          The most penetrating particle size (MPPS), that is, the minimum
          in these kinds of curves, typically occurs in the 50-500 nm range and
          is the focus of several other similar studies (see references in
          <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a>). Here we
          focus on the larger particles, which remain relevant for bioaerosol applications.

      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          Not necessarily! This graphic does not give an indication of the feasibility of the different layers,
          as they do not have a standardized weight, pressure drop, thickness, or compatibility.
          We again refer the interested reader to
          <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a>
          for a more detailed discussion.
        </p>

        <p>
          A pertinent example is gauze, which, when combined in multiple layers
          (up to 48 layers if selected from the dropdowns, where each filtration
          layer itself is composed of 16 layers of gauze),
          yield face masks that are extremely bulky.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another example is the dried baby wipes, which would work fine as an
          insert but may be suboptimal in constructing the outer layers.

    <div class="text-outside">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><span class="plus">+</span> What do the line colours in this graphic represent?</button>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          The colours of the solid lines
          correspond to the material classes for the individual filter layers,
          with the same colours as those used in the previous graphic (for example,
          yellow is for knitted materials).

    <div class="text-outside">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><span class="plus">+</span> Why might one consider the poor filter layers?</button>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          While some materials contribute very little to the filtration properties, they
          may have other advantages. For example, some layers may absorb moisture.
          However, it is important that these layer do not add a lot of pressure drop
          to the mask, for reasons noted above.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="text-outside">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><span class="plus">+</span> What do the qualifiers on the pressure drop (e.g., low) mean?</button>
      <div class="text-indent">
        <p>
          These give a sense of the significance of the pressure drop,
          using the N95-compliant mask as the standard (or <b>moderate</b>) pressure drop.
          Pressure drops sufficiently below the measured N95-compliant pressure drop are
          considered low, while pressure drops higher than the N95-compliant
          masks are considered high.
          The real significance of the pressure drop will depend on other factors,
          such as how hard an individual is breathing. As such, these estimates
          are only an initial guide to the user.
        </p>

        <p>
          Generally, for improvised masks, <b>low</b> pressure drops are preferred,
          as the masks do not fit as well as N95-compliant masks.
